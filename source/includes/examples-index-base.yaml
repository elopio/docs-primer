  MongoDB supports :ref:`compound indexes <index-type-compound>` which
  are indexes on multiple fields. The order of the fields determine how
  the index stores its keys.

  For example, the following operation creates a compound index on
  the ``"cuisine"`` field and the ``"address.zipcode"`` field.
  The index orders its entries first by ascending ``"cuisine"``
  values, and then, within each ``"cuisine"``, by descending
  ``"address.zipcode"`` values.
